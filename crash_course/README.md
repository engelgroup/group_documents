Quick tip: if a paper is behind a paywall, paste this before the url: http://ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/login?url=
If the Harvard library has access to the paper, you'll be able to log in and read the paper.
Example: https://science.sciencemag.org/content/369/6499/30.full is behind a paywall, so instead, do this:
